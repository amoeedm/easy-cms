# Easy CMS Populate

## About
The Kikora CMS <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amoeedm/easy-cms/master/icon.png" height="30"> is designed around users populating cells to initialize a Google Sheet before updating the Google Sheet with content. Easy CMS Populate automises this by populating the Google Sheet columns using three parameters: `Course Id`, `Owner` and `numberOfExercises`.
